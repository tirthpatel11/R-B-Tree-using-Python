# R-B-Tree-using-Python

A red-black tree is the variation of the binary search tree with the property of self-balancing. A red-black tree is also called symmetric binary B-Tree. Every node of the red-black tree contains an extra attribute denoting the color of the node, specifically, either red or black. The importance of these colors in the nodes of the tree ensures that the tree is balanced while insertion and deletion operations of the node. Therefore, the red-black tree follows the below properties:

* Time Complexity:
For insertion, deletion, and search operation, the time complexity for the red-black tree is logarithmic function i.e. O(log n) where n is the total number of nodes in the red-black tree. Whereas, the space complexity of the red-black tree is O(n).

* Advantages of Red-Black Tree:
1. Red-black tree balance the height of the binary tree
2. Red-black tree takes less time to structure the tree by restoring the height of the binary tree
3. The time complexity for search operation is O(log n)
4. It has comparatively low constants in a wide range of scenarios

* Disadvantages of Red-Black Tree:
1. Relatively complicated to implement
2. The red-black tree is not rigidly balanced in comparison to the AVL tree

* Applications of Red-Black Tree:
1. A red-black tree is used to implement the finite maps
2. It is most important to implement the Java Libraries Packages like java.util.TreeSet and java.util.TreeMap
3. A red-black tree is used while building the Linux kernel
4. A red-black tree is used to implement the standard template library in C++
5. It is used to implement the CPU scheduling algorithm like “completely fair scheduler” in Linux.
6. A red-black tree is used in reducing the time complexity in the K-mean clustering algorithm
7. It is used in MySQL for table indexing
8. A red-black tree is used in Computation Geometry Data structure
